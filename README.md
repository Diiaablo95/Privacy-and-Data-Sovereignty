# Privacy and Data Sovereignty Component
## Description

The Privacy and Data Sovereignty (PDS) component provides mechanisms that allow actors to better control their data, as well as mechanisms that protect clientsâ€™ privacy.

In its present form, this component extends the IAA component in the following ways: (i) it enables flexible authorisation server delegation, and (ii) it enables client authentication and authorisation using verifiable credentials (VCs).

### Architecture Overview

The PDS component is composed of 5 sub-scomponents: Client, Smart contracts, IAA blockchain agent, Authorization Server, and IoT platform.

#### Client
This this sub-component includes libraries that can be used by an external client application in order to access a platform using the PDS component. 

#### PDS blockchain agent
This module is used for verifying VCs

#### Authorization server
This entity is an enhanced version of the [OAuth2 php server](https://github.com/bshaffer/oauth2-server-php). It supports verifiable credentials and access control delegation. 

#### Setup script
The setup script creates configurations that can be used for testing with Hyperledger Indy docker-based testing pool


### Relation with SOFIE

More information about this component and its relation to the SOFIE project can be found in [D2.5 Federation Framework, SOFIE deliverable](https://media.voog.com/0000/0042/0957/files/SOFIE_D2.5-Federation_Framework%2C_2nd_version.pdf)


### Key Technologies

The following table includes the key technologies used for each component's modules

| Sub-component | Technologies |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Client  | Hyper Ledger Indy python SDK |
| PDS blockchain agent  | Hyper Ledger Indy python SDK   |
| Authorization server  | php compatible web server, OAuth2 |


## Usage


## Installation
The following instruction have been tested for Ubuntu 18.04
### Prerequisites

#### Client
Python 3 is required

#### PDS blockchain agent
Python 3, Hyperledger Indy SDK, and the python wrapper are required 
* sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys CE7709D068DB5E88
* sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb bionic stable"
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install -y libindy
* pip3 install install python3-indy


#### Authorization server
The Authorization-server folder should be stored in a web server that supports php and python 3, so it can be accessed over HTTP(s) (NOTE accessing the Authorization server is not secure). For testing purposes the php build-in server can be used. 

#### Setup script
The setup script creates a verifiable credential for a testing client. To achieve this it uses Hyperledger Indy docker-based testing pool, it creates the necessary wallets, and it outputs two configuration files: one that should be used with the client and another for the PDS agent. It has the same prerequisites as the PDS blockchain agent. To install Hyperledger Indy docker-based testing pool the following steps are required:
* git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk.git
* cd indy-sdk/
* checkout rc
* docker build -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool . 

### Configuration
A basic configuration for testing purposes can be generated as follows:
* Run Hyperledger Indy docker-based testing pool by executing  docker run -itd -p 9701-9708:9701-9708 indy_pool
* From the test directory run python3 setup.py
* Copy the generated client.conf in the Client directory and agent.conf in the Agent directory


## Testing
Run Hyperledger Indy docker-based testing pool by executing  
* docker run -itd -p 9701-9708:9701-9708 indy_pool
Run Authorization Server
* cd AuthAuthorization-Server/
* php -S localhost:8000 
Run the client
* cd Client
* python3 pds-client.py
